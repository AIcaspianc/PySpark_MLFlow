# **Customer Churn Prediction with PySpark and MLflow**

# **Introduction**

This project aims to predict **Customer Churn** for a **Bank** by leveraging **Machine Learning** techniques in a distributed data processing environment using **Apache Spark** and **MLflow**. With the ever-increasing competition in the banking sector, predicting **Customer Churn** is crucial for retention strategies. The project uses a **Logistic Regression** model, implemented in **PySpark**, to classify whether a customer is likely to churn based on various demographic and behavioral features.

# **Scenario**

In this case study, we analyze historical **Customer** data from a **Bank** to identify customers who are likely to churn. **Churn Prediction** models enable banks to take proactive measures, such as offering personalized promotions or improving services for high-risk customers, ultimately helping retain valuable customers. This project provides a complete **Machine Learning** workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and logging, all in a **Spark** environment with **MLflow** integration.

# **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to build a **Machine Learning** model that can accurately classify customers as likely to churn or not, allowing the **Bank** to implement effective retention strategies. By examining factors such as customer demographics, account details, and engagement, we can gain insights into the reasons for churn and predict future churn events.

# **Methodologies, Libraries, and Approaches Used**

# **Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Library Installation**: Install **PySpark** and **MLflow** in **Google Colab** for **Spark** processing and experiment tracking.
2. **Import Libraries**: Load the necessary libraries such as **PySpark**, **Pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **MLflow** for data handling, modeling, and tracking.
3. **Spark Session Setup**: Initialize a **Spark** session in **Colab** to work with **Spark DataFrames**.
4. **Data Loading**: Read the dataset from **Google Drive** into a **Spark DataFrame** and ensure proper formatting.
5. **Data Conversion**: Convert the **Spark DataFrame** to a **Pandas DataFrame** to leverage **scikit-learn** for model training.
6. **Data Preprocessing**: Encode categorical features (e.g., Gender, Geography) and select relevant features for model training.
7. **Train/Test Split**: Split the data into training and testing sets, ensuring a fair evaluation of model performance.
8. **Model Training**: Train a **Logistic Regression** model on the processed training data to predict churn.
9. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance on the test data using accuracy and a classification report.
10. **Model Logging with MLflow**: Log the trained model in **MLflow** for tracking, experiment management, and reproducibility.

# **Interpretation of Results**

The **Logistic Regression** model achieved an **Accuracy** of **81.5%** on the test set, indicating a relatively strong predictive power for **Customer Churn**. The **Classification Report** reveals additional insights into the model's performance across the two classes (0 = not churn, 1 = churn):

- For the **class 0 (non-churn)** customers, the model achieved a **Precision** of **0.83** and a **Recall** of **0.97**, resulting in an **F1-score** of **0.89**. This shows that the model is highly accurate in identifying customers who are not likely to churn.
- For the **class 1 (churn)** customers, the modelâ€™s **Precision** was **0.59** and **Recall** was **0.20**, with an **F1-score** of **0.29**. Although the model is not as accurate in identifying churners, it still provides valuable insights for customer retention strategies.

Overall, the model performs better at identifying non-churners than churners. However, with an **Accuracy** of **81.5%** and a **Weighted Average F1-score** of **0.78**, it can still be a useful tool for churn prediction. To improve performance on predicting churners, further refinements such as feature engineering or trying other models could be beneficial.

# **Notes for Further Study**

To improve and expand upon this project, consider the following approaches:

- **Try Different Machine Learning Models**: Experiment with other algorithms, such as **Decision Trees**, **Random Forests**, or **Gradient Boosting**, to see if they yield better results.
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features or transformations, such as interaction terms, to capture more complex relationships in the data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use grid search or other optimization techniques to tune model parameters for improved accuracy.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Consider **Neural Networks** if you have a large amount of data and computational resources, as they may uncover deeper patterns in customer behavior.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to get a more robust estimate of model performance, especially if the dataset is relatively small.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Cluster customers into segments based on behavior before applying the churn model to tailor predictions to specific customer groups.
- **Model Interpretability**: Use tools like **SHAP** or **LIME** to interpret model predictions and understand the influence of each feature on churn.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the model in a real-time environment to monitor churn predictions and take immediate action when necessary.
- **Continuous Monitoring and Retraining**: Regularly update the model as new customer data becomes available to ensure ongoing accuracy and relevance.
